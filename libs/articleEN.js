spent many idle hours relaxing on the deck , reading ,eat ing a sandwich when
she was hungry and in the evening watching the sky turn from brilliant orange
to peach and finally to pale purple , eventually the light becoming dim . It was
about this time that the mist would begin to rise from the cool water hiding in
the dense forest that hugged(环绕,拥抱) the shoreline(海岸线). Late evening
dew(露水) glistened(闪耀,反光) on every bush and soon the loons' (潜鸟) call
would resound (回响) across the water . She decided to take on last dip in the
lake. As the cool night air touched her arms. She gave a little shiver and decided
it was time to move inside.`

days, problems had arisen between Lesley and Jeff, but they did not extend to
Zac. He was a good kid, just entering kindergarten. The couple had come to a
mutual agreement , as dictated by the legal custody(监管,保管) agreement .It
stated that each parent would share Zac's care every second weekend and this

couple had settled down to an urban lifestyle. However, after three years and
one child the dreamlike marriage came smashing down. One disadvantage(不
利条件) of being young and ambitious(有抱负的) was that both of them needed to
devote untold hours to their busy schedules. As a result of these late hours,
Lesley became suspicious(猜疑的) of Jeff‟s after hours activities. She accused
him of making her part of a love triangle. The who le miserable scene was to set
the proceedings(过程,诉讼,诉讼程序) for an ugly(不愉快的) divorce in motion.`

did not appear. When noon hour arrived and he still had not appeared, she
started making some phone calls. None of their mutual friends had either seen
or talked with Jeff that day. Until today, Jeff had always been very punctual
about returning the boy at the appointed time. Lesley felt a knot forming in her
stomach as a crazy thought persisted at the back of her mind. She was
absolutely sure something was wrong.`

arrangement with his former wife was proving to be awkward. He was frustratedat being able to see his son only on weekends and felt he was always making
concessions to accommodate(适应,迁就) Lesley‟s work schedule. Every meeting
was turning into a competition for the boy‟s affection. His one desire was to take
Zac away for good. The enormous decision to undert ake this plan appeared to
be presenting itself. Today he would depart for a conference in California. This
appeared to be a marvelous opportunity to take the boy and leave the country
for good. He bet that he could pack sufficient baggage into his vehicle and then
disappears across the border, gaining entry the U.S.A. He gave little thought to
whatsoever of the fact this act could lead to his conviction if he was tracked
down by the cops.`

reality of the situation deepened. After 48 hours, the spokesman for the district
police department assured her they would investigate Zac‟s disappearance. Her
faith that justice would be realized was faint. The shock of the past two days‟
events made her realize that possibly her son would become one more statistic
in the missing children file. The police completed a preliminary survey after

tracking Zac‟s whereabouts(行踪). As the days passed, Lesley‟s frustration(挫败)
mounted and she felt a sense of alarm. Eventually, she decided to take the
initiat ive in continuing the search and she began to use well-established child
find agencies. At times, boosted by hopes, she appeared to be on the right trail
with a sense of disgust, but her hopes were dashed at the final moment. These
obstacles hope. After Zac‟s picture was circulated nationwide, telephone calls
followed from strangers reporting sightings(被看见的人或事物) of a Zac look alike.`

of an attorney. Lesley became determined to target every major city where Jeff
normally contracted business. As the months slopped by, Lesley‟s exhaustion
became noticeable in her eyes. Her cheeks became hollow pits. Most days she
felt as though she did not have an ounce of energy left because proof of Zac‟s

locate her ex-husband. In her handbag she carried the necessary proof that
would identify her to the authorities if she was successful in being able to bring
Zac home again, to Canada. She had been impatient for this moment to arrive
for so long and yet now she just wanted to secure her son with a minimum of
fuss. Now, right on cue, a tall stranger slipped into the bar and sat down. One
glimpse told her it was Jeff. He looked weary(疲劳的) and older but definitely
familiar. A chill ran up her spine(脊椎,脊柱). Close to success, she refused to
concede defeat. It was the time to remedy the enormous sadness. This time she
wanted a guarantee of success. She stared straight ahead with a vacant look,
trying to grasp the important moment. Vivid scenes, from the pass two years‟
